The MS8607 sensor is a self-contained pressure, humidity and temperature sensor that is fully calibrated during manufacture.
The sensor can operate from 1.5V to 3.6V. The MS8607 is ideal for weather station applications embedded into compact devices and
any applications in which pressure, humidity and temperature monitoring is required. The pressure sensor will operate down to
10mbar which is equivalent to an altitude of approx. 31,000m making it suitable for high altitude ballooning and other low pressure
applications.
